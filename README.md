## What is this?
This is my current personal website. I made this in a very short period of time (8 hours of work or less) over a period of a few days in pure HTML/CSS/JS. The HTML is pretty messy—it is formatted completely correctly, but it is extremely repetitive and uses some inline styling and quick fixes I came up with on the fly. The CSS is by far less messy—the commented out code and the few random media queries are the main culprits (could also use some comments to designate sections of code.) Overall, I plan on redoing this when I have more time to spare.

TODO:
* [ ] local scripts instead of fetching them
* [ ] basic sandbox boilerplate
* [ ] display: flex; to center main div at the beginning
* [ ] organize css
